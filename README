One tool to rule them all
=========================

General Overview
----------------

AstroMetrics is a CLI tool that can help you when interacting with multiple Cloud Environments. This tool has been tested with Openstack environments as well as Rackspace Public Cloud and AWS. This is a VERY early stage tool and overall functionality is limited, however with a bit of time the tool should be able to provide for most, if not all of the functionality you seek from your cloud provider.
